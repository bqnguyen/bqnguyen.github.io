<h1>Hello World, welcome to my analysis on property taxation.</h1>
  <p> Here you will find out how to:
  <uli>estimate property tax for a given property<li>
  <uli>explore why current property tax algorithm is biased and in favor off large structure type properties such as apartment complexes.</li>
<p>Attached is my class work project on machine learning.</p>
<p> The project is about predicting tax revenue potential given a property. It also points out how tax is bias toward favoring large apartment complexes. They shoulder less tax than other type of properties.</p>
