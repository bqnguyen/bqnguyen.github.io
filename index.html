<h1>Hello World, welcome to my analysis on property taxation.</h1>
  <p> Here you will find out how to:</p>
  <uli>estimate property tax for a given property<li>
  <uli>explore why current property tax algorithm is biased and in favor off large structure type properties such as apartment complexes.
       <li>This finding points us to a further study to examine if biased on taxing properties also create bias toward any group of individuals</li>
       <li>This find also presents an opportunity for tax assessors to increase tax on the larger complexes. This will increase the city revenue.</li>
   </li>
