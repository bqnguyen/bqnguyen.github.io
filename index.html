<h1>Hello World, welcome to my analysis on property taxation.</h1>
  <p> Here you will find out how to:</p>
  <li>estimate property tax for a given property</li>
  <li>explore why current property tax algorithm is biased and in favor off large structure type properties such as apartment complexes.
    <ul>   
    <li>This finding points us to a further study to examine if biased on taxing properties also create bias toward any group of individuals</li>
       <li>This find also presents an opportunity for tax assessors to increase tax on the larger complexes. This will increase the city revenue.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
